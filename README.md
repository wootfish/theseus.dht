# theseus.dht

For the full specification of the Theseus DHT Protocol, see [here](https://wootfish.github.io/theseus.dht/).

This repo is dedicated to development of a working reference implementation of the protocol.
It is written in Python 3, using the Twisted framework.

The implementation is not yet complete.
You can find brief discussion of main outstanding goals [here](https://wootfish.github.io/theseus.dht/#implementation-status).
Contributions are welcomed and invited.
Since active development is currently taking place throughout the codebase, it might be a good idea to get in touch before starting any big undertakings.
